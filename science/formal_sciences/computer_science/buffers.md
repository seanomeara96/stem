a data buffer is an address to a physical region in storage where data is stored temporarily while it is being moved from one place to another

typically data is retrieved from an input, say a microphone, and is stored in a buffer before it gets to the ouput device

great analogy found on stack overflow likens it to eating sweets out of a bowl. as you regularly take sweets from the bowl someone fills the bowl so that you dont suddenly run out. that way you can always be sure that there is something in the bowl when you go to take from it

the bowl is the buffer in this analogy

if youre watching a movie online and it loads(buffering) the web service will continuously download the next 5 minutes or so into a buffer. this way the computer doesnt have to donload it as you watch. the play speed sometimes or often exceeds the download speed so that that would be super annoying


its a place to store things temporarily to mitigate differences between input speed and output speed
