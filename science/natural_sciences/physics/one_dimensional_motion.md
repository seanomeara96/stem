# physics foundations
## intro to vectors & scalars
vector has a magnitude(size) & direction
scalar only has magnitude(size)

moved a distance == displaced
displacement is a vector quantity - has a **direction**

2.5m/s is a scalar quantity as it only provides a magnitude and not a direction
2.5m/s to the right is a vector quantity (2.5 being the magnitude of the speed)
velocity is a vector
# distance, displacement and coordinate systems
## distance and displacement introduction
from origin go 10km east 5km south and 10km west what is the distance travelled vs displacement?
total distance travelled == 25km
but net change position == 5 km south
net change position & direction == displacement
# average, velocity & average speed
# velocity & speed from graphs
# average & instantaneous acceleration
# motion with constant acceleration
# objects in freefall
