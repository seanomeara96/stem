moved a distance in a direction == displaced

if you move the couch from a position on the ground floor of the house to the same position on the 1st floor of the house the displacement is 1 story in the vertical direction. the distance travelled takes into account the fact that you dragged that sucker into the hallway before hoisting ti up the stair into the landing first

getting from one point of a circle to the point on opposite side of the circle the displacement would be the diameter of the circle but the distance travelled (assuming you moved along the circumference of the circle) would be equal to pi times the radius of the circle

from origin go 10km east 5km south and 10km west what is the distance travelled vs displacement?
total distance travelled == 25km
but net change position == 5 km south
net change position & direction == displacement

## measuring displacement
Xf - Xi = displacement
direction(final position)
