## intro to the coordinate plane
y = 2x - 1
x = -2
y = 2(-2) - 1
y = -5
(-2, -5) ==> cartesian coordinates. named after decartes (x, y)

## evaluating algebraic expressions
evaluating means to form an idea fo the amount, number or value of something and more specifically in maths it means to reduce something to a number or a or an equivalent expression

similar to in [[programming]] when an expression is evaluated

## what is a coefficient
a coefficient is a constant placed before and multiplying a variable in algebraic expressions

in the example 2x + 2x the 2s are coefficients
2x + 4y 2 is the coefficient of x and 4 is the coefficient of y
